# Weather App

This weather app is for the weather in Stockholm. Showing the weather for today and a forcast for the next five days. The app is built from a template where I've had to fill in some of the Javascript and use fetch and promises to get the data from a weather API.

## The problem

Through studying of the course material and some much needed guidance from teachers and fellow course members, I managed to get the app working and also to tweak it a little bit with headers and "feels like" temerature. With more time and knowledge I would fetch weather icons from the API and insert them in the five day forcast. I would also make it possible to change the city, to be able to see the weather in any city.
